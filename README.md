# T20-Data-Driven-Performance-Analyzer
The recently concluded T20 Cricket World Cup saw England emerge victorious over Pakistan, providing a rich dataset for a new cricket data analytics series. This initiative revolves around employing data scraping techniques from ESPNcricinfo, followed by data cleaning and transformation using tools like Pandas and Power BI to develop a high-performing cricket team from the tournament‚Äôs data. Led by senior data analyst Tony Sharma, the project aims to devise an algorithm to select a cricket team capable of averaging 180 runs while defending a target of 150 runs. The selection process involves categorizing players into various roles like openers, finishers, and bowlers and evaluating them based on critical metrics such as batting averages and strike rates.

Scraping match results and player data efficiently using Bright Data ensures secure access to necessary datasets. The transformation of data into a usable format (CSV) facilitates the creation of visual analytics dashboards. As part of the project, tutorials will cover data transformation using Python and Pandas, leading to new column creation and dataset merging.

Detailed explanations of the data modeling process, including the development of calculated columns and the importance of visual aesthetics in dashboard design, are also included. Furthermore, the project encourages participants to apply analytical methods for player selection and offers opportunities to win prizes through a final challenge, fostering community engagement and competition.


Key Insights
üîç Importance of Data Analytics in Sports: The project exemplifies how data analytics is revolutionizing sports strategy. Having a well-defined methodology for data collection, cleaning, and analysis allows teams to make informed decisions to improve their performances and game strategies. In cricket, where conditions can dramatically influence match outcomes, leveraging historical data offers teams a competitive edge.
